My Graduation Project at Mutah University 
E-government (short for electronic government) is the use of technological communications devices, such as computers, mobile, and the Internet, to provide public services to citizens and other persons in a country or region. E-government offers new opportunities for more direct and convenient citizen access to government, and for government provision of services directly to citizens without their presence in the ministries and government institutions.
There are many goals for e-government, including creating a better environment for business, as the use of information and communication technology in the government helps to simplify interaction and interactions between the government sector and the business sector and the transparency in dealing between the citizen and the government institution to get the services the citizen need. This is what our project report on “Dilni” app is doing in partnership with the Crown Prince Award for Best Government Service Application in the Business Sector.
During the development of this project, we explored new ideas and functions. This project is the output of our planning, schedule, programming skill and the hard work, and this document reflects our steps taken at various levels of programming skill, planning and schedule.
We have learnt a lot during this project and liked the improvement in our testing skills and deep concept related to these kinds of projects.

Most citizens face problems with government transactions because they:
•	They do not know the paperwork required for each transaction.
•	What are the procedures required to complete the transaction?
•	What are the documents that must be provided?
•	What are the locations of the government departments closest to the citizen to perform the required transactions?
•	What is the cost required for each transaction? 
•	What is the closest government department to the citizen?

This app is officially for all people in Jordan they want to know more guidelines about the government transactions, after that when anybody need to get any information about governmental services, he uses Dilni app to make the process easier, aware, limpidity, and satisfied.
